"""Scene mutation via the MuJoCo ``MjSpec`` AST.

This module used to contain ~980 lines of XML-round-trip machinery (tmpdir +
``mj_saveLastXML`` + ElementTree parse + name-mangling + regex path patching).
All of that is replaced by ``spec.recompile(model, data)`` which:

* preserves joint state on unchanged joints automatically,
* initializes new joints to body ``pos``/``quat`` (removing the need to
  delete keyframes on freejoint insertion),
* namespaces robot bodies/joints/geoms/actuators/sensors via ``spec.attach()``
  without us walking the tree manually.

Public API:

* :func:`inject_robot_into_scene` - ``spec.attach(robot_spec, prefix=...)``.
* :func:`inject_object_into_scene` - ``SpecBuilder.add_object(spec, obj)`` + recompile.
* :func:`inject_camera_into_scene` - ``SpecBuilder.add_camera(spec, cam)`` + recompile.
* :func:`eject_body_from_scene` - ``SpecBuilder.remove_body(spec, name)`` + recompile.
* :func:`eject_robot_from_scene` - walk the spec, delete everything namespaced
  under ``{robot_name}/``, then recompile.

Every function takes a ``SimWorld`` whose ``_backend_state["spec"]`` holds the
live ``MjSpec``. They return ``True`` on success, ``False`` on failure (matching
the legacy API) so call sites in ``simulation.py`` don't need to change.
