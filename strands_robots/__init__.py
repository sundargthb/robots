Strands Robotics - Universal Robot Control with Policy Abstraction

A unified Python interface for controlling diverse robot hardware through
any VLA provider with clean policy abstraction architecture.

Key features:
- Policy abstraction for any VLA provider (GR00T, ACT, SmolVLA, etc.)
- Universal robot support through LeRobot integration
- Clean separation between robot control and policy inference
- Direct policy injection for maximum flexibility
- Multi-camera support with rich configuration options

Lazy Loading:
    Heavy imports (Robot, tools, Gr00tPolicy) are deferred until first access.
    Heavy imports are deferred so ``import strands_robots`` stays fast when lerobot/torch
    are installed but not yet needed.

    Light-weight symbols (Policy, MockPolicy, create_policy) are available
    immediately since they don't pull in torch/lerobot.
